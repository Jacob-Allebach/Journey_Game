# Journey
## What is the game?
Journey is a game heavily inspired by the classic Atari game Adventure that I created using Processing 3 where you are a black square navigating a maze-like map while collecting keys and battling enemies. It utilizes object oriented programming to create every item, wall, and enemy in the game as well as loading each of those by using a two-dimensional array as a map-like system to keep track of where the player is. It also contains custom sprites and enemy behavior that reacts to the player's movement. Though I am not currently continuing to work on this game, I am satisfied with how it came out as the map system I used and the objects I created all have specific uses to make the game more fun and interesting.

## How to download and play
To play this game, it is required to have Processing 3 installed in order to open the files to hit run. Once Processing 3 and the game files are downloaded, you can run the game by opening `journey_game.pde` and pressing the "Run" button in the upper left corner of the menu. I hope you enjoy!
